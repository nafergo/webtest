Steredenn was a <strong>huge critical and commercial success</strong> (for us at least) and we’re so grateful that we’ve been able to this for the last years.</p>\n\n<p>We’re deeply thankful for all the people we met and all the players we had.</p>\n\n<p>And we secretly hope that Steredenn will continue to be played in the next fifty years. 💪</p>\n\n<p>Some notes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Steredenn: Binary Stars is coming to iOS on Jan. 2019.</strong></li>\n  <li>We are still supporting Steredenn (i.e. fixing bugs - a patch is coming, btw).</li>\n  <li>We have a final surprise later in 2019.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We are keeping the company alive for at least one or two years. Feel free to contact us if you have any request or question regarding our services or our games. <em>But Pixelnest Studio will not be our main activity anymore</em>, so don’t expect a quick answer. 😉</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://matthieuoger.com/\">Matthieu</a> is looking for a <strong>Product Manager</strong> job in Paris (or Amsterdam). <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/matthieuoger/\">LinkedIn resume here</a>.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://dmayance.com/\">Damien</a> will continue being a <strong>freelance game developer</strong>. <a href=\"https://fr.linkedin.com/in/damienmayance\">LinkedIn resume here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone, it was a fantastic ride for both of us! 🙏</p>\n\n<p>💋💋💋</p>\n",
